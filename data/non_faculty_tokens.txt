by the of and ext papers in and in the of research interests and of has published journal articles concerning large cardinals and the attempt to provide mathematical foundation for them cardinals are extremely large infinite sets that sometimes arise in mathematical practice the standard mathematical foundation cannot account for them large cardinals are in principle underivable from the axioms research begins from the observation that the assertion there exists an infinite set is an assertion about the existence of something local in the universe observes that proper understanding of the mathematical infinite requires deeper global expression for the existence of the infinite in formulated such global statement showing that the existence of certain type of functor is equivalent to the existence of an infinite set where is the universe of mathematics later showed that somewhat stronger functor of the same type is equivalent to the existence of measurable cardinal one of the better known large cardinals work then extends the properties of these functors to the fullest possible extent asserts the existence of an elementary embedding with the additional property essentially that the restriction of to any set is itself set is sufficient to derive all large cardinals for the derives from in which it is seen that all expressions in the universe arise from the self interacting dynamics of wholeness the field of consciousness itself similar fashion it can be shown that all sets in the universe are the expression of the dynamics of the wholeness embedding as in discusses in his commentary on the individual expressions arise in the collapse of an unbounded value to its point value and subsequent expansion from point to infinity the case of the this is seen by the fact that has critical point first point moved and this point gives rise to compact expression analogous to the itself from which all particular sets are seen to emerge referral of it is observed that all dynamics in the universe are the expression of self referral dynamics of the pure field of existence computation is exact and without mistake because it is based on the dynamics of wholeness itself interacting with itself in parallel fashion it can be shown that all computation can be proven to be represented in recursive algorithm and all recursive algorithms are known to have purely self referral definition in the form where is recursive operator from to where is the set of all partial functions from to these self referral dynamics are given expression in the untyped lambda calculus the lambda calculus it can be shown that every term has fixed point term for which this fact and the representability of arithmetic in the lambda calculus one shows that this fixed point point property of terms in fact lies at the basis for all recursion in mathematics and computer science and therefore at the basis of all computation is in the process of writing book for general readership on these topics and discusses these points in his course on of seven of years in the software development industry his work was centered around devleoping good design for mid scale rules engines has been recognized in recent years that significant business asset for many modern companies is their business rules legacy systems rules underlying business processes are handled in software implementation simply as if then statements sprinkled through millions of lines of code need to represent rules in an external repository and in language that lends itself to modification by the non programmer have led to the emergence in recent years of rules languages developed one such language in recent project for an insurance company and has more recently upgraded his approach by making use

the of of of there are no bioimaging application models that have the capability to tag organelles as dynamic social networks able to model these patterns as evolving networks with respect to time will yield additional insights not possible with existing bioimaging methods analytical framework designed in this project was implemented using open source tools such as and which will help increase the accessibility of these tools and the transparency of future analyses experimentation with various packages and scientific image processors numerous images were produced that quantified the number of non zero pixels in actin channels the centroids of the cells and the segmented parts of the cells the limited time frame of ten weeks there were no evident morphological changes observed between the uninfected and infected slides of the hours and hours time points to the lack of facilities and lower costs monocytogenes was used as model but to characterize the spatio temporal evolution of organellar networks the next step of this project will use cells infected with tuberculosis and pneumophila respectively completed framework will quantify changes in organellar shape quantity and spatial distribution over large sequences of stack microscope images and digital videos which will improve our understanding of how cellular mechanisms respond to their environments of the for the summer collaborated with and on advancing the and its related components primarily involved working on improving the user interface for the online web editor for developing solutions and examples for the textbook and testing the static type checker for the objectdraw library which basically helps students programming in identify their mistakes better and improve their programming the user interface for the online web editor in involved learning and in order to add several features to the editor that would overall improve the user experience order to implement these new features to the web editor learned more about the in as well as saving and deleting information on the local storage of modern web browser an understanding of the was able to implement recursive tree traversal algorithm that allowed the user to create directories and subdirectories and files within the directories the process of developing solutions and examples for the textbook learned more about the syntax and mission of the language the process of translation was able to gain deeper understanding of how improved the learning process for students beginning to learn computer science and for the summer assisted in his work on the programming language is new language designed to facilitate the teaching of programming concepts to students eliminates some of the unnecessary complexities of other languages to reduce the learning curve for those new to computer science has been taught in introductory courses at and will be taught again in the fall of my projects was to build documentation generator for takes in well commented code and outputs pages containing documentation of that code similar to the way works for the compiler ignored comments entirely so had to modify the parser to preserve comments in the abstract syntax tree wrote program to translate that abstract syntax tree into set of pages other project was to fix the statically typed dialect of language is statically typed if it checks the types of all objects at compile time for correctness and consistency does not do this but static typing is good teaching tool thus this dialect was created to enforce these rules for students the start of summer the dialect did not work for all cases still not perfect but have made significant progress major improvement was to make the compiler write information about types declared in module to file visible to other modules allows for type checking against types from imported modules tree parsing in lexical simplification tasks work examines the task of lexical simplification which reduces the reading complexity of sentences by replacing certain words with simpler more accessible variants work on the project built an initial corpus from corresponding sentence pairs extracted from and which we utilize in this project to learn word simplifications first train feature based ranking function using linear support vector machine on set of labeled simplifications collected using the collected aligned sentences we extract simplification rules which include candidate word replacements and word replacement frequency applying these rules to simplify different sentences we modified the system to automatically identify words to be changed in testing data rather than requiring manual identification of the words to be simplified then created and refined simplification rules and predictive language features feature to compare the original and modified sentences parse syntax tree found that in the original system of the sentences were changed with precision of and an accuracy of the inclusion of the new feature we saw the precision and accuracy increase to and respectively with of sentences modified however these numbers proved to be non significant although slight improvement did demonstrate progress in the right direction of on in networks can be used to represent interactions between users on members of sports league or neurons within the human brain community within network is set of members that are more connected to each other than to other members communities might represent groups on or college athletic conferences in the many applications we are interested in identifying communities within these networks based solely on the interactions observed majority of commonly used algorithms for detecting communities optimizes metric known as modularity which compares the density of connections of members within community to members of other communities other quality metrics such as conductance coverage performance and silhouette index could also be used within those same algorithms this study we examined the impact of replacing modularity with coverage in existing implementations of the and community detection algorithms results suggest that the metric used does not dramatically affect the communities identified and of the rise of multicore powerful and massive supercomputers parallel computing has become increasingly relevant to both regular consumers and members of the high performance computing community many parallel programming languages and libraries result in programs being tied to only one particular type of parallel computing architecture by lacking support for other architectures or by forcing programmers to write their programs in such way that prevents them from performing well on other architectures solves these issues by supporting multiple parallel computing architectures and handling many important details itself gives the freedom to tailor program implementations to the architecture they will be running on resulting in good performance across architectures tested by using it to implement variety of approaches to solving graph problems on and then compared the performance of against popular parallel programming language for and popular parallel programming language for also compared different approaches with each other to see which ones worked best found that generally performed as well as both and when run on sufficiently large graph problems there were some instances where was significantly better and some instances where was significantly worse than or of researchers around the world use the file format to represent genome sequence data the data in single file must be accessed sequentially this standard has created bottleneck in the performance of sequence alignment tools study examines the extent to which using an alternative to based on the can improve the performance of the sequence alignment tool was modified to support input in format natively of format conversion tool was measured when the same read data were given in uncompressed compressed and formats modified version of processed reads at rate that increased at rate of approximately reads per millisecond per doubling of the number of threads up to maximum of reads per millisecond with eight threads throughput was reads per millisecond for uncompressed and reads per millisecond for compressed rates did not vary substantially with the number of threads used file size was not found to be related to throughput results of this investigation suggest that has the potential to be scalable solution to one significant input and output bottleneck but that additional changes in will be required in order for support to match or exceed the performance of older formats by of of the into programming language project was started with the intention of developing an object oriented programming language that would make it easy to teach programming to novices this end we have to provide not only simple and flexible language amenable to different teaching styles and programming paradigms but also robust environment in which novices can learn to program decided to take an integrated development environment for the programming language and extend it to support allowing us to take advantage of its numerous built in beginner friendly features through language binding capabilities order for to understand code we wrote parser that takes code or the surface representation and interprets it to build an or the underlying syntax typechecker that builds type environment and supports the typechecking of any combination of statically typed and dynamically typed code and an interpreter that translates the semantics of the into code so that can evaluate it as it would any other program provided by and present research on intelligent music software dedicated to helping both beginner and expert jazz musicians improve their playing first introduce the creation of audio input capabilities accomplish this through programming language used for audio synthesis use pitch and onset detection to detect notes and rests which we then send as input to integrate existing external software to make this feature as portable as possible also describe an automated method for style recognition of jazz melodies through the use of supervised training train neural network to recognize defining stylistic elements of specific musicians then present melodies to critic for judgment on grading scale and for prediction of the musicians to whom the melodies sound most similar by in place using the to explore large for way to permit free exploration of any sized virtual environment and provide some of the inertial cues of walking is to have users walk in place et al each step is treated as virtual translation even though the participant remains in the same location our prior work et al we had success in implementing method using an inexpensive showed that participants spatial orientation was the same as normal walking and superior to joystick navigation were two major drawbacks to this algorithm our step detection algorithm had half step lag participants found it slightly annoying to walk in place on the small board the current work seeks to overcome these limitations by implementing an algorithm to using two sensors each we are interested in seeing how well users can explore large by with the to the large size of the comparing these results to normal physical walking is not possible we directly compare to joystick navigation we examine scaling the translational gain of so that one step carries the user forward two steps referred to as this within subject experiment compares subjects spatial orientation as they navigate in three conditions provided by graph clustering stability graph is collection of objects nodes and connections between pairs of objects edges have been used to study phenomena such as social networks where the nodes represent people and edges represent friendships nodes into clusters such that two nodes within cluster are more likely to be connected than two nodes from separate clusters can reveal structures such as communities in social networks clustering algorithms have been proposed popular measures of clustering strength are computationally unfeasible to maximize and algorithms can at best compute reasonably good clusterings importantly clustering algorithms will return partition of the nodes even for graphs lacking community structure investigate how to determine whether the returned clusters represent meaningful structure in the graph present an algorithm agnostic method of examining stability and thus meaningfulness of clusters after running clustering algorithm on the initial graph we add single edge not present in the original graph and re run the clustering algorithm distance between the clustering on the original and on the modified graphs is recorded and this experiment is repeated for large number of edges not present in the original graph hypothesize that the distribution of recorded distances carries information about stability and present experimental data collected on variety of synthetic and real world graphs in the ever expanding scope of computer mediated communication especially in this age of social media and instant communication there are some interesting and meaningful questions being raised on how we communicate and the subsequent implications specifically we have investigated the influence of anonymity on the behavior of users is technology news site which posts articles and allows readers to post comments in response st switched from the commenting platform to the commenting platform marking the end of condoned anonymity in their online community did this in the name of or the attempt of reducing intentionally negative or destructive user contributions looked at trends between the two corpora as wholes as well as between the user groups which we characterize as having varying degrees of anonymity from totally anonymous to pseudonym to using users real names within the individual corpora evaluated comments in terms of several qualitative as well as quantitative metrics in is programming language that is currently in development with the eventual goal of being used to teach introductory computer science courses programmed extensively in to find some remaining bugs and provide feedback on the experience of actually using the language the end produced code for various data structures using structures as guides and translated some of the projects and assignments from and into of the problems encountered were due to features of the language that were not yet fully implemented and the lack of extensive and current documentation but once those issues are resolved should be easy to learn and straightforward to write by for programming language project was started with the intention of making new object oriented language for teaching the practice of programming order to be successful must be easily usable by novices and significant factor towards that goal is having beginner friendly integrated development environment or decided to use as an for allowing us to take advantage of its numerous novice friendly features and powerful language building capabilities developed new backend language with semantics but with style syntax also wrote pretty printer that will take processed abstract syntax trees of code and return an equivalent program will allow us to input program into and run it there translating it into as an under the hood intermediate step allowing us to maintain compatibility with many useful tools provided by in of lori keala

computing in and was the inaugural director now more commonly known as chair of the of when it was founded as graduate unit in more the was the father of computing of is saddened by the loss of one of the three founding members of our department and one of preeminent scientists his many contributions had exceptional ability in being able to translate difficult issues into things that were accessible be it through the academic texts he wrote or his work wrote the compiler for the computer the first computer in and only the second to be sold commercially in the world precursor of was invaluable at the of enabling faculty and students at and elsewhere to write programs easily gift for translating complicated subjects was shown best in collaboration with professor as they co hosted the ground breaking program of through which they made science accessible to general audiences with fellow chairs and pioneers and was part of the exceptional team of leaders who not only created the of but moreover made it into an outstanding department building an international reputation for quality and fostering wonderful atmosphere that all faculty staff and students still enjoy and treasure today chair from used his communication skills to gain recognition for and bring resources to the department created solid foundation with his colleagues and always remained extremely supportive of future chairs many years up to the mid or late the department held annual parties and eventually parties and now seasonal parties was of course an accomplished actor and artist as well as scientist and he and took the lead in writing and acting in the annual skits that we performed in those parties his experience it was not surprise that could make science funny and interesting parties were part of the wonderful atmosphere that was essential in building the department addition in those early days with relatively small department the chairs would often have dinner parties for the department faculty and the hosted many such events one such occasion prepared the meal single handedly and carried on the meal as sole host had wonderful sense of humour and loved teaching could learn the names and faces of everyone in large class and if someone came in late he would welcome them by name to join the class taught for many years after retirement he decided he would no longer teach any courses he remarked that the students now don laugh at the same things that do was an insightful way to recognize the changing demographics the importance of enjoying teaching and the sense of when to move on to other things insights humour and smile are permanent part of our departmental legacy are all grateful to have had such leader in the department and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends the announcement here the of announcement here is with great sadness that we announce the sudden death of on joined the of faculty in and served in number of roles including for and the of

science was founder of the field of computer system performance made influential contributions to both the theory and practice of computer system performance evaluation seminal work on queueing network models has had lasting impact on industrial practice and provides foundation for much of the performance research that has followed it researchers know him for his work on grid files an early multidimensional indexing technique that remains on the required reading list in most programs and for his extensive work on database system performance was an early member of the of the premier organization for the promotion of research in performance analysis he received the in recognition of career devoted to sustained long lasting and high impact contributions to computer system performance evaluation in the technical leadership and mentoring dimensions his career at the of he graduated over and students in performance evaluation parallel processing and database systems

intriguing problems that lie at the heart of understanding how data can be modeled managed and queried in computer systems established fundamental and influential results in the theory of data management with many applications that only came decades later example his work provided the basis for languages used to search the web volume of these applications is testament to the truly foundational nature of his research was one of our most prolific researchers who published some refereed articles in journals conference proceedings and books supervised students and students volume of research funding he brought to the is impressive also served the database research community by editing journals organizing conferences and in many other ways became the first of the then newly

psyco pedagogic model navigation community offers based secondario out more about the psyco pedagogic model of documents for business and with us about donations psyco pedagogic model student of our distance teaching is at the centre of the educational process being guided by the new profile professor tutor who has the task of supplying him with the tools that are best suited to make the web based learning and communication process easier psycho pedagogic and didactic model was born from the results achieved by years of international research programs and was realized by our and by her research team model main educational tool of the is the based learning environment where teaching and learning are carried on in languages and it allows implementing new psycho pedagogic model that is characterized by the shift teacher central role to the student central role knowledge transfer to knowledge creation integration between practice and theory passive and competitive learning to active and collaborative learning psycho pedagogic model is characterized by the highest degree of flexibility for the student this model the student can build his own learning path in function of his educational needs and of his skill level learning environment developed in such way does not limit itself to offer rigidly pre established courses but it offers dynamic contents that can be enriched by other contents existing on the in the the student is at the centre of the educational process however he is guided by the new profile of the professor telematic tutor who has the task of supplying the tools needed to facilitate the networked learning and communication process in synchronic and diachronic way the the students actively participate in the creation of their own learning paths being guided by expert teachers tutors guided path leads the learner into the various virtual places that were designed and in each of them it is possible to implement training session based on specific model of communication the digitized video lessons the student uses linear learning mode which is still linked to classical teaching mode but thanks to the modular structure of the contents the student can exploits the hypertextual modes to study and consult books related to the issues being treated the virtual laboratory the student can check and enhance his knowledge according to learning by doing mode being supported in itinere by tutoring system the systems of chats forums wikis and with the web based virtual classrooms and on second finally the student can carry out collaborative learning sharing the phases of the learning process with other students coming from different linguistic and social settings through web based meeting each learning environment it is possible to integrate each single learning mode with the other ones simultaneously and enrich them with various possibilities multimedia term is intended in its widest meaning and the learning activity is structured in such way as to avoid wasting time and confusion and promote the spreading of knowledge though various means simple to complex video lesson and intelligent library theory to application projection learning by doing in the virtual laboratory guided exercises to research on the the individual study to interactive dialogue between professors and students collaborative learning through synchronic and diachronic communication and sharing tools main didactic tool is the based learning environment www uninettunouniversity net the didactic cyberspace can access various learning environments each delivered course the student has at his disposal conceptual map graphical two dimension and hypertextual representation in which the macro issues included into each course the lessons included into each macro issue clicking on each single lesson the student can see the issues it contains and what the materials associated to the whole lesson or each single macro issue that are treated in it psycho pedagogic model the videolessons play major role they are recorded by professors coming from the best universities of and of the world then they are digitized and posted online on an interface allowing hypermedia use student can watch the videolessons according to linear sequence or decide to control the teaching process by pausing going backwards or moving along the time line of lesson as he likes and he can use the tools made available on portal by means of the interface designed by the student can surf among the videolessons moving from one to another within the same videolessons using the indexing option that allows him to select specific sub issue treated by the video professor and play the video to the second in which the professor starts to treat that specific issue or among the more in depth materials related to that specific video lesson by means of the box at the right of it addition in some specific moments bookmark lighting signal highlights or one of the types of more in depth study materials listed in the box at the right of the video indicates to the student that specific more in depth study material associated to what the professor is speaking about in that specific moment of the videolessons this way the learning process becomes an hypermedia process the student can access more in depth contents suggested in real time by hypermedia bookmarks structured by professors and researchers that allow him directly access to books and articles that is to say texts lecture notes produced essays selected and made available by professors and tutors multimedia materials photo galleries films associated to videolessons bibliographical references and selected lists of websites collections of references to external materials validated by professors and tutors experts of each single course in scientific terms exercises and virtual laboratories exercises and virtual labs the students have at their disposal materials that will allow them to put into practice the knowledge learnt through the study of training materials described above goal is to create powerful synergy in the virtual laboratory so that theoretical learning and practical problem solving co exist in the correct ratio and fully integrate each other the student will be able to think about his experiences in the learning environment and the abstract principles described by the teacher become motivated are made operative and can be committed to memory thanks to the problem solving activities exercises available for each course the self evaluation exercises allow the student to get an independent feedback lesson by lesson on which is the comprehension level gained on the specific subjects that he studied progress check exercises to be submitted to the professor tutor through the portal are assessed by professors who so doing will give their feedback and direct comment on which is the learning progress achieved by the students on the macro issues for which he is assessed the the students can utilize online simulations for benefitting from tools that would be accessed only from excellence research centres as well as use theoretical knowledge learnt in learning by doing activities on materials otherwise not accessible the professor tutor supervises and monitors the student activities who once he completes his experience automatically sends the sheet with the results of his work to the his own tutor learning environment gives the student an absolutely active role all the training materials are made available for this purpose student is not left alone but he is guided by an expert tutor is the reason why the portal has special area called online tutoring the and professors tutors and students discuss about the issues proposed by the professors they further analyze specific issues ask questions on key points of the subject being studied addition and plan synchronic meetings on regular basis in virtual classrooms in which the students can exchange views with their own colleagues and their professors via chat video streaming on the live or in the virtual classrooms in the of knowledge on second life student whole learning process is continuously monitored by the professors and tutors students are organized in classes with numerosity varying from to students for each class organization in classes allows tracing course attendance and the learning progress of each student in quantitative as well as in qualitative terms quantitative terms the tracing system of portal supplies reports and statistical data on the individual study activities of each student accesses to the materials of each course time of use of the videolessons time spent by each student in studying the texts and training materials associated to the issues treated in the videolessons qualitative terms the teacher tutor has the task of checking the students learning progress through exercises as well as during meetings taking place in the during which the teacher tutor ask the students questions on the issues dealt in the videolessons and check their comprehension and mastery level of the these issues for each student and including their assessments on qualitative assessment sheet for each single student data beside populating the student sheet that is used by the teacher to decide the admission or not to the exam of the individual student who is required to have attended the course having watched the videolessons having taken part to the tutoring activities to be admitted to the final exam are aggregated and represent tool for having feedback on the progress of the whole class means of data that are aggregate per class the teacher tutor can immediately see whether there any problems shared by the whole class on specific course issues once he identifies common problem he can take measures in itinere during the same course delivery period supplying more in depth study texts moderating discussion on forum or planning some meetings on the virtual classroom meant to fill the gap that this feedback system allowed highlights model of interaction between teacher tutor and students applies the pedagogical theories which are based on the fundamental assumption that involves not one way teacher to student teaching but an active participation of the learner in his her learning process the teacher leads the students to personalized learning continually encouraging them to participate activelly in the construction of his her knowledge construction is made of continuous and dense dialogue exchange of questions and answers that allow direct comparison between opposing views art of maieutics the method based on the dialectic is method of an active and interactive learning supports motivates and encourages his pupil to never stop learning enhancing his her work where it is worthy of praise and stimulating him her when he she encounters difficulties interactivity develops in dialectic manner the teacher against the student the teacher together with the student with single goal the knowledge conquest teacher tutor offers topics and presents his her thesis on forums talks with students in the virtual classroom determines the objectives to be achieved the students study analyse reinterpret revitalise and enrich the content with new ideas new knowledge create new topics of study that become the topics of discussion in the next interactive virtual classrooms become active builders of new knowledge to one scenario learning in single mode this scenario by means of meetings in chat and video chat the teacher tutor assists the individual student in the exploration process of different environments providing continuous assessment of the realised learning path whenever the student requests it this phase the teacher tutor through interactive dialogues in the style helps the student to examine his her reasoning and to discover and correct both the errors and the causes that determined them to many scenario learning in collaborative mode this scenario by means of forums wiki and synchronous appointments in the on the and on the of on the teacher tutor organises and structures the sessions of collaborative learning to foster moments of interaction among different actors of the learning process teacher tutor intervenes in the work of the groups in order to guide their work code number mail info pec uninettunouniversity net tel tel mail info uninettunouniversity net st floor th floor you need further information us your contact
